        <p class="bio">
          I consider myself I restless person, always looking for something new
          to learn and new paths to improve what have been done. If I am not
          learning and applying it, then I feel stagnant. I am curious by
          nature, always wanting to get to know how things works, and if
          reachable do it myself. I am kind of adventurous, I love travel,
          walking in unknown streets, betweeen unknown people, if the language
          is also unknown, the better the whole experience is. In fact one of
          the thing that more catch my attention and make me motivated about the
          tech world is the possibilitty of sometime work remotively and doing
          so work from whatever place I prefer to. I am pretty sure that
          travelling around expand the mind and enrich the life.
        </p>
        <p class="bio">
          I try to keep a healthy balance between work and personal life. I give
          a great deal of importance to the food I eat, the water I drink and
          the air I breathe as I consider them the source of my energy and
          vitalogy. Activities that I enjoy the most are yoga, trekking (if in
          mountains trails, the better), running and reading.

            Rios, Misiones, Corrientes, Salta, Jujuy, Tucuman, Santiago del
            Estego and dozen of cities and cozy towns. Though my life and in

        <div class="skill-row">
          <h3>Travel through Australia and Southeast Asia</h3>
          <p>
            <img class="icon" src="images/location-dot-solid.svg" />For 1 year I
            travel, work (as a cleaner of luxury boats), learn English an enjoy
            a lot living in Australia and travelling to Singapore, Malasya,
            Thailand and Camboya.

        <div class="skill-row">
          <h3>Sudamerica</h3>
          <p>
            <img class="icon" src="images/location-dot-solid.svg" />I have gone
            a couple of times to Peru (from south to north), Ecuador, Uruguay
            and Chile. And for working reasons I know a little bit of Brazil and
            Colombia.

        <div class="skill-row">
          <h3>Ecology and sustainable development</h3>
          <p>
            <img class="icon" src="images/location-dot-solid.svg" />I have taken
            several courses with a lot of practice along them in topics such as
            agroecology, bioconstruction, permaculture, medicinal herbs. All
            these subject pretend sustainable ways of produce food, build houses
            and treat certain diseases, mitigating the impact on our planet and
            on our health. On those occasion I got my hand on duty, sowing and
            reaping variaty of fruit and vegetables, building houses using
            natural material, or harvasting herbs for selective teas. Most of
            these experiencies were as a volunteer, exchanging my time for
            something to eat and a place to sleep. In return I got invaluable
            knowlegde from real masters and unforgettable moments sharing time
            with local people and workers who teach us about their customs and
            perpectives.
